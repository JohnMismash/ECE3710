This document provides an overview of Group 1 and our respective Final Project
details for our Connect 4 digital logic game.

Our final project directory contains our source Verilog HDL code, our Python
Assembler code, as well as testing files or testbenches needed for the project.
It may be important to the reader to know this code is somewhat, incomplete.
Our group was not able to finalize the overall structure and functionality of
connecting the memory containing the game state and integrate it in sync within
our bit generator file for the VGA connection/output.
